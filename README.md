# Predicting Daily Bicycle Demand for Capital Bikeshare

To predict the bicycle demand for tomorrow based on yesterday’s demand along with various other environmental and situational factors, the following models were created post the data preparation:

1. Neural Network
2. Random Forest of Regression Trees
3. Generalised Linear Model
4. GLM with Poisson Error Distribution
5. Ensemble of nnet, rpart, glm & knn

All these models were then compared against a Default Model which predicted tomorrow’s demand to be same as yesterday’s.
